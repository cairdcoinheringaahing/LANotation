# LA Notation

A repository to create and improve notation for Legacy's Allure games

---

[Legacy's Allure](https://legacysallure.com/) is a customisable, card-based war game, played on a hexagonal grid. This project aims to create and develop a form of recording notation for games, to allow users to create a record of their games, replay them, analyse their moves, and more. The repo also includes a series of games, all anonymised, that demonstrate the notation.

This repo assumes a basic level of knowledge of Legacy's Allure and its mechanics. The basic mechanics are explained in order to provide context to the notation, but should not be interpreted as rulings, nor as a tutorial to the game.
